00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.020
JOJI - ATTENTION

3
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.120
So keep it light

4
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.900
So keep it light

5
00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:21.840
Girl, would it kill you just to throw a little bit of attention?

6
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.980
If I hurt you, I'm afraid God's gonna teach me a lesson

7
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.080
Now would you hate me if I said goodbye

8
00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.840
So quick you could eat my dust?

9
00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.380
Now would you hate me if I ran like hell

10
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.380
In the wind from dawn 'til dusk?

11
00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.440
When you cry, you waste your time

12
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.540
Over boys you never liked

13
00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.340
Can you not

14
00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.100
be so obvious?

15
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.100
So keep it light

16
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.520
So keep it light

17
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.760
No

18
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.460
I thought I'd vocalize my troubles, but nobody will listen

19
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.100
I know I'm cryptic and I'm weird

20
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.100
that shit comes off as indifferent

21
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.420
I don't wanna die so young

22
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.380
Got so much to do

23
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.120
I don't smile for the cameras

24
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.080
Only smile for you (smile for you)

25
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.220
Now would you hate me if I said goodbye

26
00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.660
So quick you could eat my dust?

27
00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.480
Now would you hate me if I ran like hell

28
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.500
In the wind from dawn 'til dusk?

29
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.780
When you cry, you waste your time

30
00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.520
Over boys you never liked

31
00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:59.840
Can you not?
